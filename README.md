# React DockerOps

This project demonstrates how to deploy a React application using Docker, set up CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, and automate deployment to Docker Hub. The setup ensures that the React app can be easily built, tested, and deployed in a containerized environment.

## Project Setup

The project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to quickly get started with React development. 

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the default build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project for full control.

## Deployment

This repository also demonstrates how to deploy the application using Docker, set up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline with Jenkins, and automate the deployment to Docker Hub.

- Docker ensures the application is containerized and ready for deployment in any environment.
- Jenkins is configured for CI/CD automation, ensuring that updates are deployed smoothly and efficiently.
